# horiseon_marketing_project

In this project, I took the existing code for a a website and refactored it. I went throught both the html and css files to clean up the formatting and consolidate commands where possible. The purpose of this was to make the code easier to read, as well as ensuring all links and features of the website work as intended. The website also lacked the needed descriptions of images to make it compliant with accessiblity standards, so I went through and made sure all images were properly formatted and had complete descriptions. Through this project, I learned about properly configuring both html and css files. I also gained first hand experience with going through existing code and debugging problems that were occruing in the live site. Overall, my work improved the site for the customer and created a fully functioning, compliant site for their customers to visit.
